:trumpet: *DAY 2 of 60: June 29, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: We organized and attend to our first meetup in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Look at the photos.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: We spent more than 4 hours in our meetup talking about #UdacityFacebookScholar, #60daysofudacity, and artificial intelligence in general.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: We also suggested 3 tentative projects to develop as a team, mainly healthcare projects in which the privacy of patients is important.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I will continue watching the lectures of the nanodegree and programming the associated Jupyter notebooks.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 3 of 60: June 30, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: My overall progress in this nanodegree is now 56%. I'm in *Lesson 5 - Introducing Local and Global Differential Privacy* (89% completed).<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I have implemented my own formula to deskew the query. However, my formula does look equal to the formula in the video. I tried to algebraically manipulate the formula in the video to transform it into my formula; but I couldn't. Fortunately, both formulas work well and produce values close to 0.5, as expected.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I will continue watching the lectures of the nanodegree and programming the associated Jupyter notebooks.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 7 of 60: July 4, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: My overall progress in this nanodegree is now 91%. I'm in *Lesson 9 - Encrypted Deep Learning* (11% completed).<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: The Lesson 8 on *Securing Federated Learning* was really interesting. I always wanted to know about distributing sharings and the trick with large prime numbers. Thank Udacity so much. I'm really happy.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I talked to 3 classmates from Latin America (@EPR, @Fustincho, and @Casimiro.Rocha) in order to create our own Study Group for Hispanic people.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I asked to #ama_sessions a question about private messages, Study-Groups, and their channels: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJF1DQDEW/p1562265842273700<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I will meet a potential client who wants to hire me to build a deep learning system capable of analyzing the facial emotions of potential employees in the videos of job interviews. I will propose 2 approaches: One approach with only convnets and transfer learning with VGG16. And another approach with RNNs, convnets, and transfer learning with VGG16. RNNs are supposed to disambiguate patterns by analyzing context. I will also propose to analyze the emotions in their voices, not only their faces. I'm deeply thankful to Udacity for teaching me all these concepts in the previous PyTorch Facebook scholarship.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, and @Ruben Romo to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 8 of 60: July 5, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: My overall progress in this nanodegree is now 100%. I just finished my last lesson: *Lesson 10 - Challenge Course Wrap up*.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: The Lesson 9 on *Encrypted Deep Learning* was well taught. Encrypted Deep Learning is an awesome technology. I didn't know that frameworks such as OpenMined and Syft existed today. Thank Udacity so much for educating us.
:heavy_check_mark: I noticed that *Lesson 10 - Challenge Course Wrap up* does not have a final project common to all of us, like the final project of the previous *PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook*. The final project will be rather a personal project to be developed, documented, and posted on Slack in the corresponding channels. From now on, I will focus on developing and documenting my final project.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I participated again in the competition *Boom with the Basics*. I answered 4 questions about artificial intelligence, 15 minutes per question. This contest was 1 intense hour of writing answers. Thank @Khush for your encouraging words.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: We, people from Ecuador, are really happy to see that our Study Group #sg_ecuador was created. People from Ecuador are invited to join us. Now we will use our own public channel #sg_ecuador instead of sending private messages.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I also joined 2 Study Groups from Latin America: #sg_hispanic and #sg_latin.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, and @Ruben Romo to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>
![Day 8](images/Day%2008.png)

:trumpet: *DAY 9 of 60: July 6, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I already decided to start working on an easy project, whose dataset is linearly separable. (I could choose a more complex project if I had enough time to do so.) The medical dataset I chose contains features and diagnoses of 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*. This medical dataset truly needs privacy! Because we cannot divulge the sexually-transmitted diseases of patients.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I started to program the code of the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of the 2 diseases of the urinary system.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I started to write the documentation of my final project, at least a basic structure of the essay.
:heavy_check_mark: I noticed I was one of the winners of the competition *Boom with the Basics*. Thank @Khush for your encouraging words. Moderators selected my answer to the *Question 2: What are the basic building blocks of a deep learning model?* https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1562432616409400<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, and @Ruben Romo to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: I continued writing the documentation of my final project, at least a basic structure of the essay.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I met David Dávila @dfdavila, an Ecuadorian neuroscientist who lives in Quito, the capital of Ecuador. I added him to our Study Group #sg_ecuador. It is refreshing to find people who are passionate about both artificial intelligence and neuroscience. I love neuroscience as well and I would like to study an online masters in neuroscience, if possible. Here is our conversation: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CL5KYB9FX/p1562527182006800<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, @Ruben Romo, and @dfdavila to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I recently received my 2 AGI t-shirts that I bought in January 26, 2018. My first shipment was lost due to a hurricane in Florida. My second shipment was lost for an unknown reason. And finally my third shipment arrived without problems. Fortunately Teespring paid for the reprints. So, I only paid for 2 t-shirts.
*Nowadays, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a legitimate and very active field of research, as you can see in these links:*
https://agi.mit.edu/
http://agi-conf.org/
I have so many ideas and papers to publish in the AGI Conferences. :heart_eyes: <br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 11 of 60: July 8, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I have read an important message in #announcements regarding the requirement to create a github repository to track the progress of the final project. Therefore, I was reading a little bit about the Unix commands to handle github repositories. Here is the announcement: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJQ1C1X08/p1562610830350200<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I have read another message in #announcements about the #sg_project-t-shirt competition. So, I was thinking about how to generate art with style transfer and generative adversarial networks, aka GANs. Here is the link of the #sg_project-t-shirt competition: http://bit.ly/tshirt-project_spaic<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I participated again in the competition *Boom with the Basics* in the channel #beginners. I answered 4 questions about artificial intelligence, 15 minutes per question. This contest was *1 intense hour* of writing answers. This is the link for Question 4: What is PCA? https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1562598916473600<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, @Ruben Romo, @dfdavila, and @Santiago Frias. I encouraged them to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>
:eye: P.S. In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project.<br/>
![Day 11](images/Day%2011.jpg)

:trumpet: *DAY 12 of 60: July 9, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today I went to the Mechatronics Lab at ESPOL <http://www.espol.edu.ec/> in order to have a long meeting (3 hours) with @Christian Tutivén (our classmate of #UdacityFacebookScholar, professor of Mechatronics, and ambassador of STEAM Center and Saturdays.AI), Jaime Palomeque (ambassador of STEAM Center and Saturdays.AI), and some professors of Mechatronics. And we talked about many things:
- the contents of this nanodegree and why it is important;
- the final project of this nanodegree;
- PySyft and PyTorch;
- my involvement in a Deep Learning startup to analyze facial emotions, verbal emotions, and body language;
- some ideas to analyze facial emotions by using convnets, facial landmarks, RNNs, and GANs.<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: I watched again all the video lectures of *Lesson 8 - Securing Federated Learning*.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I watched again all the video lectures of *Lesson 9 - Encrypted Deep Learning*.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 13 of 60: July 10, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I created my github repository to track my daily activities with photos for the #60daysofudacity pledge of the Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge: https://github.com/jckuri/60daysofudacity<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I noticed I was one of the winners of the competition *Boom with the Basics*. Moderators selected my answer to the Question 3: What is a hyperparameter?<br/>
https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1562759109025700<br/>
To be honest, I will keep participating in *Boom with the Basics* even if I will lose one or many times. I love the rush of adrenaline provoked by exam-like questions for 1 intense hour. It reminds me of my experiences as a student of ESPOL and Georgia Institute of Technology. And it prepares me for the Ph.D. in machine learning I plan to study.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I continue learning the Unix commands to handle github repositories. So, I will be able to track the progress of my final project.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I watched some YouTube videos of Siraj Raval on style transfer and generative adversarial networks, aka GANs, in order to participate in the #sg_project-t-shirt competition: http://bit.ly/tshirt-project_spaic<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I created my first design for the #sg_project-t-shirt competition. Not exactly the proper use of style transfer and GANs. But it is Anakin Skywalker saying: "I pledge myself to ~your teachings.~ #60daysofudacity" :joy:<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, @Ruben Romo, @dfdavila, and @Santiago Frias. I encouraged them to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 14 of 60: July 11, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I found and watched this incredible video of Siraj Raval, which is quite relevant for the channel #sg_project-t-shirt<br/>
Generative Adversarial Networks for Style Transfer (LIVE) [1 hour] https://youtu.be/MgdAe-T8obE<br/>
And I shared it in many channels of this nanodegree.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I continued programming the code of the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of the 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: In few days, I will share the code of my final project through an open github repository. At the beginning, I was hesitant to share my code, due to plagiarism. (Our Universities are so obsessed about plagiarism and teach such obsession.) But the point of #UdacityFacebookScholar is to help our classmates. So, I decided to open my source code to help my classmates understand better the concepts of this nanodegree. Here is how I changed my mind in this thread: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJW72L5D2/p1562785075337700<br/>
And I will program my final project as a Jupyter notebook explaining in detail what I did, in order to educate the readers.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, @Ruben Romo, @dfdavila, and @Santiago Frias. I encouraged them to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I also encouraged back my classmates from the world: @Khush, @Sankalp Dayal, @Ricardo Pretelt, @Sourav, @EPR, @Yaak, and @PaulBruce.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I updated my github repository to track my daily activities with photos for the #60daysofudacity pledge of the Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge: https://github.com/jckuri/60daysofudacity<br/>
I also posted my daily activities on the Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/secureandprivateai/<br/>
:eye: P.S. In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 17 of 60: July 14, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I continued programming the code of the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of the 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I'm really stuck with a programming error when doing logistic regression in the Jupyter notebook of my final project. See the photo.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I created the github repository of my final project: https://github.com/jckuri/BladderDataset <br/>
However, it contains errors, yet. <br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, @Ruben Romo, @dfdavila, and @Santiago Frias.

:trumpet: *DAY 18 of 60: July 15, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I continued programming the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*. *Here is the github repository of my final project: https://github.com/jckuri/BladderDataset *<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I managed to correct the programming error of my final project and now my accuracies in the train dataset and test dataset are 100%. It is that accurate because the dataset is linearly-separable.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I participated again in the competition *Boom with the Basics* in the channel #beginners. I answered 4 questions about artificial intelligence, 15 minutes per question. This contest was *1 intense hour* of writing answers.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I noticed I was one of the winners of the competition *Boom with the Basics*. Moderators selected my answer to the Question 4: What is the cumulative distribution function (CDF)? Try to type the equation as well.<br/>
https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1562944539105800<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I attended this Webinar: AMA with Robert Wagner | Secure & Private AI Challenge Scholarships<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: I continued programming the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*. Here is the github repository of my final project: https://github.com/jckuri/BladderDataset <br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I carefully read, thrice, this excellent blog about Hinton's Capsule Networks:<br/>
https://cezannec.github.io/Capsule_Networks/<br/>
I ran and read its associated Jupyter notebok "Capsule Network in PyTorch" at: https://github.com/cezannec/capsule_net_pytorch<br/>
And I carefully read the associated Hinton's paper "Dynamic Routing Between Capsules": https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: I noticed I was one of the winners of the competition *Boom with the Basics*. Moderators selected my answer to the Question 3: What is sensitivity analysis for? https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1563457372260400<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today I seriously thought about my t-shirt design at #sg_project-t-shirt. I searched and found some awesome images to project in abstract feature spaces à la style transfer and GANs. I already designed everything in my mind. And I will create a github repository with a Jupyter notebook to create my t-shirt design programmatically from scratch.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I watched this 1-hour video: Secure & Private AI Challenge - 60 Days of Udacity - Project T-Shirt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_vhbNpyIk4<br/>
And I read all the resources of its associated github repository: https://github.com/parthatom/GANonTshirtTutorial<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I ran and read the Jupyter notebook at: Deep Learning Nano Degree - Face Generation https://github.com/sinha-kirti/face-generation-with-GAN/<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: Today, I participated again in the competition *Boom with the Basics* in the channel #beginners. I answered 4 questions about artificial intelligence, 15 minutes per question. This contest was *1 intense hour* of writing answers.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: For a second time, I ran and read the Jupyter notebook at: NEURAL TRANSFER USING PYTORCH https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html<br/>
I highly recommend this Jupyter notebook to those who will participate in the #sg_project-t-shirt competition.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I did my first experiments of transferring the style of abstract designs into real-world images, for the #sg_project-t-shirt competition. But the results are not satisfactory, yet. See the photo.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I watched this YouTube video:<br/>
True Artificial Intelligence will change everything | Juergen Schmidhuber | TEDxLakeComo<br/>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y7PLaxXUrs<br/>
Prof. Schmidhuber said some really powerful statements:<br/>
"There will be a little computational device that can compute as much as all 10 billion human brains taken together and there will not only be one of those devices but many." :flushed: <br/>
"Technological evolution is a million times faster than biological evolution." :flushed: <br/>
