:trumpet: *DAY 2 of 60: June 29, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: We organized and attend to our first meetup in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Look at the photos.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: We spent more than 4 hours in our meetup talking about #UdacityFacebookScholar, #60daysofudacity, and artificial intelligence in general.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: We also suggested 3 tentative projects to develop as a team, mainly healthcare projects in which the privacy of patients is important.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I will continue watching the lectures of the nanodegree and programming the associated Jupyter notebooks.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 3 of 60: June 30, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: My overall progress in this nanodegree is now 56%. I'm in *Lesson 5 - Introducing Local and Global Differential Privacy* (89% completed).<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I have implemented my own formula to deskew the query. However, my formula does look equal to the formula in the video. I tried to algebraically manipulate the formula in the video to transform it into my formula; but I couldn't. Fortunately, both formulas work well and produce values close to 0.5, as expected.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I will continue watching the lectures of the nanodegree and programming the associated Jupyter notebooks.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 7 of 60: July 4, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: My overall progress in this nanodegree is now 91%. I'm in *Lesson 9 - Encrypted Deep Learning* (11% completed).<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: The Lesson 8 on *Securing Federated Learning* was really interesting. I always wanted to know about distributing sharings and the trick with large prime numbers. Thank Udacity so much. I'm really happy.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I talked to 3 classmates from Latin America (@EPR, @Fustincho, and @Casimiro.Rocha) in order to create our own Study Group for Hispanic people.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I asked to #ama_sessions a question about private messages, Study-Groups, and their channels: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJF1DQDEW/p1562265842273700<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I will meet a potential client who wants to hire me to build a deep learning system capable of analyzing the facial emotions of potential employees in the videos of job interviews. I will propose 2 approaches: One approach with only convnets and transfer learning with VGG16. And another approach with RNNs, convnets, and transfer learning with VGG16. RNNs are supposed to disambiguate patterns by analyzing context. I will also propose to analyze the emotions in their voices, not only their faces. I'm deeply thankful to Udacity for teaching me all these concepts in the previous PyTorch Facebook scholarship.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, and @Ruben Romo to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 8 of 60: July 5, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: My overall progress in this nanodegree is now 100%. I just finished my last lesson: *Lesson 10 - Challenge Course Wrap up*.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: The Lesson 9 on *Encrypted Deep Learning* was well taught. Encrypted Deep Learning is an awesome technology. I didn't know that frameworks such as OpenMined and Syft existed today. Thank Udacity so much for educating us.
:heavy_check_mark: I noticed that *Lesson 10 - Challenge Course Wrap up* does not have a final project common to all of us, like the final project of the previous *PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook*. The final project will be rather a personal project to be developed, documented, and posted on Slack in the corresponding channels. From now on, I will focus on developing and documenting my final project.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I participated again in the competition *Boom with the Basics*. I answered 4 questions about artificial intelligence, 15 minutes per question. This contest was 1 intense hour of writing answers. Thank @Khush for your encouraging words.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: We, people from Ecuador, are really happy to see that our Study Group #sg_ecuador was created. People from Ecuador are invited to join us. Now we will use our own public channel #sg_ecuador instead of sending private messages.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I also joined 2 Study Groups from Latin America: #sg_hispanic and #sg_latin.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, and @Ruben Romo to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>
![Day 8](images/Day%2008.png)

:trumpet: *DAY 9 of 60: July 6, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I already decided to start working on an easy project, whose dataset is linearly separable. (I could choose a more complex project if I had enough time to do so.) The medical dataset I chose contains features and diagnoses of 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*. This medical dataset truly needs privacy! Because we cannot divulge the sexually-transmitted diseases of patients.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I started to program the code of the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of the 2 diseases of the urinary system.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I started to write the documentation of my final project, at least a basic structure of the essay.
:heavy_check_mark: I noticed I was one of the winners of the competition *Boom with the Basics*. Thank @Khush for your encouraging words. Moderators selected my answer to the *Question 2: What are the basic building blocks of a deep learning model?* https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1562432616409400<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, and @Ruben Romo to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: I continued writing the documentation of my final project, at least a basic structure of the essay.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I met David Dávila @dfdavila, an Ecuadorian neuroscientist who lives in Quito, the capital of Ecuador. I added him to our Study Group #sg_ecuador. It is refreshing to find people who are passionate about both artificial intelligence and neuroscience. I love neuroscience as well and I would like to study an online masters in neuroscience, if possible. Here is our conversation: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CL5KYB9FX/p1562527182006800<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, @Ruben Romo, and @dfdavila to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I recently received my 2 AGI t-shirts that I bought in January 26, 2018. My first shipment was lost due to a hurricane in Florida. My second shipment was lost for an unknown reason. And finally my third shipment arrived without problems. Fortunately Teespring paid for the reprints. So, I only paid for 2 t-shirts.
*Nowadays, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a legitimate and very active field of research, as you can see in these links:*
https://agi.mit.edu/
http://agi-conf.org/
I have so many ideas and papers to publish in the AGI Conferences. :heart_eyes: <br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 11 of 60: July 8, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I have read an important message in #announcements regarding the requirement to create a github repository to track the progress of the final project. Therefore, I was reading a little bit about the Unix commands to handle github repositories. Here is the announcement: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJQ1C1X08/p1562610830350200<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I have read another message in #announcements about the #sg_project-t-shirt competition. So, I was thinking about how to generate art with style transfer and generative adversarial networks, aka GANs. Here is the link of the #sg_project-t-shirt competition: http://bit.ly/tshirt-project_spaic<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I participated again in the competition *Boom with the Basics* in the channel #beginners. I answered 4 questions about artificial intelligence, 15 minutes per question. This contest was *1 intense hour* of writing answers. This is the link for Question 4: What is PCA? https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1562598916473600<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, @Ruben Romo, @dfdavila, and @Santiago Frias. I encouraged them to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>
:eye: P.S. In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project.<br/>
![Day 11](images/Day%2011.jpg)

:trumpet: *DAY 12 of 60: July 9, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today I went to the Mechatronics Lab at ESPOL <http://www.espol.edu.ec/> in order to have a long meeting (3 hours) with @Christian Tutivén (our classmate of #UdacityFacebookScholar, professor of Mechatronics, and ambassador of STEAM Center and Saturdays.AI), Jaime Palomeque (ambassador of STEAM Center and Saturdays.AI), and some professors of Mechatronics. And we talked about many things:
- the contents of this nanodegree and why it is important;
- the final project of this nanodegree;
- PySyft and PyTorch;
- my involvement in a Deep Learning startup to analyze facial emotions, verbal emotions, and body language;
- some ideas to analyze facial emotions by using convnets, facial landmarks, RNNs, and GANs.<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: I watched again all the video lectures of *Lesson 8 - Securing Federated Learning*.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I watched again all the video lectures of *Lesson 9 - Encrypted Deep Learning*.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 13 of 60: July 10, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I created my github repository to track my daily activities with photos for the #60daysofudacity pledge of the Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge: https://github.com/jckuri/60daysofudacity<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I noticed I was one of the winners of the competition *Boom with the Basics*. Moderators selected my answer to the Question 3: What is a hyperparameter?<br/>
https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1562759109025700<br/>
To be honest, I will keep participating in *Boom with the Basics* even if I will lose one or many times. I love the rush of adrenaline provoked by exam-like questions for 1 intense hour. It reminds me of my experiences as a student of ESPOL and Georgia Institute of Technology. And it prepares me for the Ph.D. in machine learning I plan to study.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I continue learning the Unix commands to handle github repositories. So, I will be able to track the progress of my final project.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I watched some YouTube videos of Siraj Raval on style transfer and generative adversarial networks, aka GANs, in order to participate in the #sg_project-t-shirt competition: http://bit.ly/tshirt-project_spaic<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I created my first design for the #sg_project-t-shirt competition. Not exactly the proper use of style transfer and GANs. But it is Anakin Skywalker saying: "I pledge myself to ~your teachings.~ #60daysofudacity" :joy:<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, @Ruben Romo, @dfdavila, and @Santiago Frias. I encouraged them to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 14 of 60: July 11, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I found and watched this incredible video of Siraj Raval, which is quite relevant for the channel #sg_project-t-shirt<br/>
Generative Adversarial Networks for Style Transfer (LIVE) [1 hour] https://youtu.be/MgdAe-T8obE<br/>
And I shared it in many channels of this nanodegree.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I continued programming the code of the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of the 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: In few days, I will share the code of my final project through an open github repository. At the beginning, I was hesitant to share my code, due to plagiarism. (Our Universities are so obsessed about plagiarism and teach such obsession.) But the point of #UdacityFacebookScholar is to help our classmates. So, I decided to open my source code to help my classmates understand better the concepts of this nanodegree. Here is how I changed my mind in this thread: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJW72L5D2/p1562785075337700<br/>
And I will program my final project as a Jupyter notebook explaining in detail what I did, in order to educate the readers.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, @Ruben Romo, @dfdavila, and @Santiago Frias. I encouraged them to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I also encouraged back my classmates from the world: @Khush, @Sankalp Dayal, @Ricardo Pretelt, @Sourav, @EPR, @Yaak, and @PaulBruce.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I updated my github repository to track my daily activities with photos for the #60daysofudacity pledge of the Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge: https://github.com/jckuri/60daysofudacity<br/>
I also posted my daily activities on the Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/secureandprivateai/<br/>
:eye: P.S. In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project.<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 17 of 60: July 14, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I continued programming the code of the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of the 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I'm really stuck with a programming error when doing logistic regression in the Jupyter notebook of my final project. See the photo.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I created the github repository of my final project: https://github.com/jckuri/BladderDataset <br/>
However, it contains errors, yet. <br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @Christian Tutivén, @Gustavo Cevallos, @ssalvatierra, @Ruben Romo, @dfdavila, and @Santiago Frias.

:trumpet: *DAY 18 of 60: July 15, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I continued programming the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*. *Here is the github repository of my final project: https://github.com/jckuri/BladderDataset *<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I managed to correct the programming error of my final project and now my accuracies in the train dataset and test dataset are 100%. It is that accurate because the dataset is linearly-separable.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I participated again in the competition *Boom with the Basics* in the channel #beginners. I answered 4 questions about artificial intelligence, 15 minutes per question. This contest was *1 intense hour* of writing answers.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I noticed I was one of the winners of the competition *Boom with the Basics*. Moderators selected my answer to the Question 4: What is the cumulative distribution function (CDF)? Try to type the equation as well.<br/>
https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1562944539105800<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I attended this Webinar: AMA with Robert Wagner | Secure & Private AI Challenge Scholarships<br/>

:trumpet: *DAY 24 of 60: July 21, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I replied to today's ice-breaker. See my response in the photo and in this thread: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJPF5UBU4/p1563727204080400?thread_ts=1563716217.026500&cid=CJPF5UBU4<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Even if I don't pass to Phase 2 of #UdacityFacebookScholar, I think the most important lesson of this challenge has been #60daysofudacity because it taught us the power of forming habits by tracking progressions. And I decided to take 3 pledges for the rest of my life, not only for 60 days. I will dedicate at least 5 minutes a day to track 3 habits: Programming Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Calisthenics, and Minimalism.<br/>
- Artificial General Intelligence, aka AGI, is the hardest and most rewarding project imaginable. Each day, I will dedicate at least 5 minutes to think deeply about my AGI algorithms, to study publications and courses related to AGI, to program my AGI algorithms, or to connect ideas in the right way. Even if my progress is little, I will dedicate 5 minutes a day at least.<br/>
- Calisthenics is one of the most challenging sports and I can practice it everywhere, even inside my home. Each day, I will train at least basic progressions to become a calisthenics expert. Even if I will only do only 5 muscle-ups, skin-the-cat, handstands, pseudo-planche push-ups, or 10 pistol-squats, such little efforts will count toward the grand goal.<br/>
- Minimalism and life organization are important to live in a healthy, productive, and stress-free way. Hence, each day I will dedicate at least 5 minutes to organize a little part of my home, to fix something, to solve problems, or to plan activities.<br/>

I will try to stick to these 3 pledges for the rest of my life. Dedicating only 5 minutes a day is a realistic goal. Some days I could dedicate many hours if I want to. If I fail for some unknown reasons, I just retake the habits without remorse.<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I joined the channel #sg_speak_french. My native language is Spanish. In my city Guayaquil, few people speak English and almost nobody speaks French. So, this is an opportunity to practice my French, both written via chat and spoken through video conferences. Moreover, I have never practiced French in the context of artificial intelligence.

:heavy_check_mark: I filled the ‘Project Showcase Challenge - Interest Form’ : https://forms.gle/eiAG4ipFnM9BQGFVA with my project called "Diagnosing Acute Inflammations of Bladder". My project description was the following: "This machine learning system can diagnose 2 acute inflammations of bladder. The medical dataset contains features and diagnoses of 2 diseases of the urinary system: Inflammation of urinary bladder and Nephritis of renal pelvis origin. This medical dataset truly needs privacy! Because we cannot divulge the sexually-transmitted diseases of patients. So, all we learned about PySyft and OpenMined will be applied in this project."<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: My overall progress in the *AWS DeepRacer Scholarship Challenge* is now 100%. I did all the exercises. And I noticed that this problem is both deterministic and fully-observable. The state variables you can get are directly obtained from the simulation. This problem is neither stochastic nor partially-observable. So, it is really easy. Tomorrow, I will try to run the simulator in my computer.<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: I had a Zoom meeting with @Helena Barmer in order to test 2 technical aspects of Zoom for our Deep RL webinar: How to share my screen and how to save the video. However, we noticed our Internet connection experienced some glitches when I shared my screen, to show my Deep RL presentation and the demo video of Lunar Lander. We didn't know the cause of the problem. But then I noticed I have an Ultra HD monitor in my computer, which is equivalent to the resolution of 4 HD monitors combined. So, even the best Internet connection is not enough to share an Ultra HD screen (3840 x 2160 pixels) many times per second from Ecuador to Sweden. Our videocall via Zoom collapsed as expected. We hope to test the videocall again tomorrow, with a much lower screen resolution.<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: Today, I attended the *Webinar on Student Engagement* given to Udacity mentors only. We talked about student motivation and our #30DayEngagementChallenge. The dropout rate in Udacity nanodegrees is alarming. In my personal experience, I paid and I had to dropout the Deep Learning nanodegree because at that time, I was doing the OMS CS and Georgia Tech is way too time-consuming and demanding. Moreover, I was truly obsessed in graduating with GPA 4.0/4.0 (perfect score) and I did it. I truly regret I could not graduate from the Deep Learning nanodegree because now I could have been a mentor in it. Udacity is seeking mentors and I suspect the SPAIC is a strategy of Udacity to recruit future mentors for the nanodegrees Deep Learning and Computer Vision. That's why the SPAIC will select 300 empathetic scholars capable of teaching, interacting with people through online tools, and helping others. Those personality traits perfectly describe Udacity mentors and project reviewers. And trust me: Being an Udacity mentor is an awesome job.<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: I'm desperate because the deadline for the *Project Showcase Challenge* is August 20th, 2019 at 11:59 pm GMT. :fearful:<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Our team #sg_pytorch-robotics is happy and proud that we finally submitted our project *Federated Learning with Raspberry PI (PySyft)* for the *Project Showcase Challenge*. Here is the website of our project: https://pytorch-robotics.herokuapp.com/<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I've successfully programmed *Federated Learning with a Trusted Aggregator*, for my final project. By training the ML model in a federated way in 4 different hospitals, *the ML model achieves 100% accuracy in both the training dataset and the testing dataset.* I corrected many bugs. I trained 2 separate models, one for each disease. I drew the learning curves *Training Loss* and *Training Accuracy* versus *Iterations* for all 4 hospitals, 4 separate curves in the same 2 graphs. The curves are not lines; they are rather regions. Why? Because each iteration is complex: First, 5 local iterations in each worker. Then, 4 different models are sent to the trusted aggregator that averages them. Finally, the averaged model is sent back to the 4 hospitals. That's why the progress in the learning curves goes back and forth. The graph has 1000 iterations. That's why the curves becomes regions. Because the curves go back and forth too often and are quite dense. I already updated my github repository: https://github.com/jckuri/BladderDataset<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Today, I participated again in the competition *Boom with the Basics* in the channel #beginners. I answered 4 questions about artificial intelligence and security, 15 minutes per question.

:trumpet: *DAY 58 of 60: August 24, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I wrote and submitted my essay *The Learning Curves of Federated Learning with a Trusted Aggregator*, for the *Advanced Level* of the *Blogging Competition*: https://medium.com/secure-and-private-ai-writing-challenge/the-learning-curves-of-federated-learning-with-a-trusted-aggregator-8a7bd4589a32<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: I noticed an error github makes when it publishes Jupyter notebooks: Everything inside the tags \<center\>\</center\> is ignored! That's why a graph about Federated Learning does not appear in my published Jupyter notebook: https://github.com/aksht94/UdacityOpenSource/blob/master/Juan%20Carlos%20Kuri%20Pinto/Bladder%20Dataset.ipynb<br/>
Fortunately, I found a way to overcome this problem and I corrected my mistake in my personal github repository: https://github.com/jckuri/BladderDataset/blob/master/Bladder%20Dataset.ipynb<br/>
I used `<p align="center">` instead of `<center>`, like this:<br/>
```
